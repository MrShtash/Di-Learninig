    <h1>THOR ODINSON</h1>
    <p>Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians,<br> 
a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br> 
Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known<br>
as Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br> 
which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. <br> 
When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard (more commonly known as Earth) <br>
as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake, stripped of his memory. After learning humility<br>
he regained his memory as well as his godly powers. Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard <br>
as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes</p>
