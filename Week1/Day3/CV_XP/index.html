            <p> Hello, I believe that any product can be developed and improved. I was guided by this idea in my professional experience and found this approach useful while working in an international company.</p>
            <p>Using the continuous improvement approach at all my workplaces, I aсquired new skills which helped me to contribute greatly to all the fields of work. For example, studying and assisting at university helped me to gain public speaking skills and taught me to process a large amount of data easily. I gained experience in writing scientific articles, I have publications in scientific journals that are approved by the Higher Attestation Commission.</p>
            <p>The theory without experiencing it in practice doesn’t make sense to me, so I made a decision to move on. I believe that 90% of tasks that you don’t know how to do can be done with great desire and work.</p>
            <p>HoReCa gave me sociability and stress tolerance. Working in a trade center taught me to observe clients and cooperate with different departments. Bacardi company gave me experience in strategic planning, business communication with owners and building long-term relationships. There were some difficulties as well. This happened because I was promoted quickly and it created some pressure. It was necessary to quickly navigate in a new field of work that I wasn't prepared for.</p>
            <p>I noticed that everything develops faster online then offline. I started learning internet marketing and applied for an internship in digital-agency Alente. I was passionate about learning new skills. After completing the IT project administrator course, I was offered to be a mentor on the course!</p>
            <p>Young and ambitious people were working In Alente. It was the first time I saw a real team. The atmosphere motivated us to grow and help each other. I was able to go from being an IT-product sales to becoming an customer service manager and the head of the department of subscription services. After that I gained experience in project management and became a head of the development department.</p>
            <p>The team was able to solve many problems:
            <ul>
                <li>increased the projects profitability;</li>
                <li>built relationships with difficult clients;</li>
                <li>implemented PM training;</li>
                <li>defined metrics and KPI;</li>
                <li>correctly distributed the workload;</li>
                <li>introduced retrospectives and daily calls;</li>
                <li>improved the presentation of results;</li>
                <li>synchronized work of departments;</li>
                <li>described the technology of project management and regulations.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>I'll be glad to contribute, learn something new and improve my skills. If you are interested my story, contact me via WA <a href="tel:+972-53-540-72-90" class=>+972 (53) 540-72-90</a> or e-mail <a href="mailto:bassketb86@gmail.com" >bassketb86@gmail.com</a></p>
